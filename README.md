# ðŸ–¥Vanko's Toy Compiler

A toy compiler.

## File explanations

### cprocess.c

### `/helpers/buffer`
We are going to need this whenever there is an object, whose size we do not know.

### `/helpers/vector`
Used to store things. I want a vector of integer, and then we'll add something into this integer.


## Something for the future:

Do LLVM stuff ðŸ•¶
